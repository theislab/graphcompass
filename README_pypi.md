# GraphCompass
GraphCompass (**Graph** **Comp**arison Tools for Differential **A**nalyses in **S**patial **S**ystems) is a Python-based framework that brings together a robust suite of graph analysis and visualization methods, specifically tailored for the differential analysis of cell spatial organization using spatial omics data. It is developed on top on [`Squidpy`](https://github.com/scverse/squidpy/) and [`AnnData`](https://github.com/scverse/anndata).

Visit our [`repository`](https://github.com/theislab/graphcompass/) for documentation and tutorials.

## GraphCompass key analysis features include:

- Cell-type-specific subgraphs comparison.
- Cellular neighborhoods comparison.
- Entire graphs comparison.
